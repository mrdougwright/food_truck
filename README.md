# FoodTruck

## Goal
This app lets you lookup food trucks by type, returning a list in order of closest distance to your location.

## Developer
To run and test this application yourself, git clone this repository from GitHub and run the following commands to spin up an IEx shell.

```
mix deps.get
iex -S mix
```
If I'm feeling fancy and have the time, I may dockerize it for you. Otherwise you'll need Erlang/OTP 25 and Elixir version 1.14.3 locally on your machine.
